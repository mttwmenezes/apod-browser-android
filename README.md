### What is APOD?

### API
This app makes use of the [APOD API](https://github.com/nasa/apod-api), which is part of the [open APIs provided by NASA](https://api.nasa.gov/).

### Build instructions
1. Download and install the [Android Studio IDE](https://developer.android.com/studio).
2. Clone the project.
3. Open the project on Android Studio.
4. Select `Run > Run 'app'`.

OBS: By default, the app utilizes the `DEMO_KEY`, a public API key intended for testing purposes, allowing access to all functionalities. If you prefer to use your own API key, which can be generated at [NASA's Open APIs website](https://api.nasa.gov/), simply open the `ApodService.kt` file and replace all instances of `BuildConfig.PUBLIC_KEY`.
